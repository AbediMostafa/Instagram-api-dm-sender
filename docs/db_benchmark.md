# DB Load Benchmark

- Test performed on db table accounts with 100,000 fake records inserted
- Hardware: 8 vCPU, 24GB memory

## Materials:

- Python test script: `../scripts/db_load.py` with these filters

```py
filtered_accounts = Account.select().where(
            (Account.is_active == 1) & (Account.updated_at > threshold_date)
        )
```

- Models and ORM logic: `models/Account.py & models/Base.py` (peewee) - 150 queries being made to the databse using thread pool executors with different concurrencies
- Connection pool using playhouse(except for one case):
- htop for monitoring 
```py
database = PooledPostgresqlDatabase(
    database_name,
    user=user,
    host=host,
    port=port,
    max_connections=50,
    stale_timeout=100,
)
```

## Results:

### Concurrency: 1 - 30

## Conclusion

- The optimum state of concurrency is using `7 to 11 threads`; Using more threads than this only increases latency without increasing the throughput. At this level of concurrency the CPU usage was about 100%.

| Number | CPU Usage |
|--------|-----------|
| 3      | 60%       |
| 4      | 70%       |
| 5      | 80%       |
| 6      | 90%       |
| 7      | 100%      |

- Using **connection pool** has a significant impact on both throughput and latency.
